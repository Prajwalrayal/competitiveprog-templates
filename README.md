# Competitive Programming Templates

#### Templates and other files for Competitive Programming in Java and C++
---

## Structure: 

#### Algorithms
Contains my tested/not-much-tested implementations of some of standard algorithms.
Right Now, this has the following implementations : 

	- Binary Exponentiation
	- Modular Inverse
	- Sieve of Eratosthenes
	- Standard Segment Tree 
    - Segment Tree with Lazy Propogation
	- Prime factorisation in log n
	- Smallest Prime factor of a number using sieve
	- Disjoin Set Union	
	- ncr and factorial
    - Binary Lifing and usage - LCA and Kth ancesstor in log(n)

### Headers 
Contains right now, the headers for reference that I use often: 
	
	- bits/stdc++.h - for use with clang
	- debug.h - standard debugging template

### Snippets
Contains the snippets of the algorithms above in code editors I use. 

### Scripts 
Some build/test scripts that I sometimes refernce.
